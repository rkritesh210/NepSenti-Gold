# Abstract

In the evolving landscape of political discourse, especially within the context of low-resource languages, there is a critical need to understand public sentiment accurately. This paper explores the efficiency of machine learning and linguistic analysis in interpreting political sentiments expressed in the Nepali language, a low-resource language. We present a comprehensive study employing both traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced transformer-based models to analyze sentiments within political discussions on social media platforms. We also present a novel dataset, NepSenti-Gold, comprising tweets related to political events and figures, annotated for sentiment using a combination of automated tools and manual verification. The study benchmarks the performance of several machine learning models alongside transformer-based models specifically adapted for the Nepali language. Our findings highlight the superior performance of DistilBERT in accurately classifying political sentiments, reflecting the potential of transformer-based models in handling the subtleties of sentiment analysis in low-resource languages. Furthermore, we delve into linguistic features and topic modeling to elucidate the thematic structures of political sentiments. We also conclude with insights into future research directions, emphasizing the need for more robust models, diverse datasets, and improved interpretability to advance the field of sentiment analysis in underserved linguistic domains. The dataset for this work is made available at [GitHub](https://github.com/rkritesh210/NepSenti-Gold).
